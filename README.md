# pyElGamal
Python implementation of ElGamal encryption scheme


# Usage
Can perform encryption and decryption of String messages

Can perform encryption and decryption of Int values

Can perform multiplicative homomorphism and correctly decrypt

See main.py for an example


# Future Work
Multiplicative homomorphism is achieved through encrypting m

Try to do additive homomorphism by encrypting g^m
